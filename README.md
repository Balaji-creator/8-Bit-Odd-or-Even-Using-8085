# 8-Bit-Odd-or-Even-Using-8085

## Aim:
To write an 8085 microprocessor program to check whether a given 8-bit number is odd or even.

## Apparatus Required:
â€¢	Laptop with an internet connection

## Algorithm:
1.	Load the number from a specified memory location into register A.
2.	Perform an AND operation with 01H to check the least significant bit (LSB).
3.	If the result is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.
4.	Store the result in a specific memory location (odd or even flag).


## Program:

## Output:


## Result:
The 8085 microprocessor successfully checks whether a given number is odd or even and stores the result in memory.
